				<h2>About Mark</h2>
				<p>After high school, I mostly took jobs working in warehouses before switching to retail. During my time in retail,
					I decided to build on my interest in computer development and took some online classes.</p>
				<p>After having to stop doing the online learning for personal reasons, I continued into the retail field until I landed
					a job at Comcast in their call center and worked there for 3 years. After leaving Comcast, I started my career as a
					truck driver which to where I am currently. Now I am with Thinkful to develop the skills to become a Software Engineer
					and transistion to a new career path.</p>
